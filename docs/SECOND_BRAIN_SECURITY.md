# Second Brain — Security Model

The brain is governed memory. Two properties are load-bearing: **secrets never
enter memory**, and **canon changes only through explicit human approval**. This
document maps the threats to the controls that enforce them.

## Sensitive content — never stored

`brain-lib.js` `scanSensitive()` scans all captured/promoted content against these
patterns; a match refuses the write (exit 3):

- `anthropic-api-key` — `sk-ant-…`
- `generic-sk-key` — `sk-…` (20+ chars)
- `aws-access-key-id` — `AKIA…`
- `github-token` — `ghp_/gho_/…`
- `private-key-block` — `-----BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY-----`
- `password-assignment` — `password = …`

Enforced at three points: `brain-capture` (before append), `brain-promote` (before
promotion), and `brain-lint` (sweep of the whole capsule, second net). The
`brain-post-lint.sh` hook surfaces any leak that lands via a raw edit.

## Sensitive paths — never read into the brain

`brain-profile.json` `sensitive_paths` (default): `.env`, `.env.*`, `secrets/`,
`credentials/`, `private/`, `legal-sensitive/`, `client-sensitive/`, `patient/`,
`financial/`. Client/patient/financial/legal data must never enter the capsule.

## Canon protection chain (defense in depth)

1. **Script gate** — `brain-promote.js` is the *only* writer to `canon/` and
   `decisions/active/`; without `--approve` it exits 2 and writes nothing. Its
   positional path is normalized and confined to the capsule (no `../` traversal).
2. **Skill gate** — the `brain-promote` skill carries `disable-model-invocation: true`,
   so the platform itself prevents model-initiated promotion, and `risk_tier: critical`.
3. **Hook gate** — `brain-security-guard.sh` (the only blocking hook) denies:
   - direct `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` into `.project-brain/canon/` (path-normalized)
   - `Bash` mutations of `canon/` not going through `brain-promote --approve`
     (covers `cd`+relative paths and interpreter writes)
   - destructive `rm` targeting `.project-brain/`
   - direct installs (`cp`/`mv`/`ln`/`rsync`) from `reference-repositories/sources/` into the skills dir

   The guard is **defense-in-depth**: `brain-promote --approve` + git history are the
   real boundary. It fails open on parser errors (never bricks a session) and errs
   toward denial — a read command mentioning `canon/` alongside a redirect/`node -e`
   can be a conservative false-positive; split such commands.

## Reference sources — documentation only

`reference-repositories/sources/<name>/` holds source cards, never executables.
`brain-reference-repo-audit.js` exits 3 if any `.sh/.js/.py/.rb/.ps1` appears there,
if a card carries sensitive content, or if `install_policy` is not
`do-not-install-directly`. Skill/agent adoption always routes through
scout → audit → adapt → eval.

## Uninstall preserves memory

`uninstall.sh` removes brain tooling (hooks, scripts, schemas, templates, hook
registrations, the CLAUDE.md marker) but **never deletes `.project-brain/`** — it
prints a preservation note. Uninstalling tooling must not erase the team's memory.

## Incident playbook — leaked secret in the capsule

1. `brain-lint.js` exit 3 flags it (or the post-lint hook warns).
2. Locate it via the report in `.project-brain/reports/lint/<date>.md`.
3. Redact the secret from the offending file; re-run `brain-lint.js` (expect exit 0).
4. **Rotate the credential** — it may already be in git history.
5. Check `git log -p` for the file; if the secret was committed, scrub history
   (e.g. `git filter-repo`) and force-rotate. `sessions/` is git-ignored by default,
   which limits but does not eliminate exposure.
