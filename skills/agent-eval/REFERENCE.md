# Agent Eval Reference

## Scenario Types

Generate one of each type. Named evals are easier to track than "eval-0".

| # | Type | Expected dispatch | Description | Example |
|---|------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | `direct` | ✓ | Exact orchestration request derived from agent description | `"Dispatch the skill-eval-agent to evaluate skill-adapt"` |
| 2 | `paraphrased` | ✓ | Same intent, different orchestration phrasing | `"I need you to use the skill-eval-agent — specifically to evaluate skill-adapt"` |
| 3 | `edge_case` | ✓ | Unusual but valid — starts mid-workflow or uses minimal input | `"skill-eval-agent already loaded the scenarios. Have it resume from the grading step."` |
| 4 | `negative` | ✗ | Should NOT dispatch — explanation request | `"Can you explain what skill-eval-agent does? I'm not asking you to run it."` |
| 5 | `semantic` | ✓ | Synonym variation of the action verb | `"benchmark" / "assess" / "measure"` for `"evaluate"` |
| 6 | `adversarial` | ✗ | Agent vocabulary in wrong scope — must NOT dispatch | `"Use the eval agent to check my React components"` |
| 7 | `project-native` | ✓ | Uses project-specific terminology, stack, and artifact paths | `"Dispatch skill-eval-agent for our Node.js/GSD project — outputs go in evals/agents/"` |
| 8 | `project-workflow` | ✓ | Agent invoked after a sibling in the pipeline | `"After agent-adapt finished, dispatch skill-eval-agent to evaluate it"` |
| 9 | `multi-turn` | ✓ | Continuation framing from mid-session | `"[Continuing from earlier] We agreed to dispatch skill-eval-agent. Go ahead."` |

Types 1–6 always generated. Types 7–9 require `--context evals/project-context.json`.

**Repetitions:** Run dispatch-type scenarios (direct, paraphrased, semantic, negative, adversarial) 3 times each. Run workflow-type scenarios (edge_case, project-native, project-workflow, multi-turn) once per side — these have dispatches:true but test execution quality, not trigger consistency.

## LLM Judge Rubric

Use a faster model (e.g., Haiku) as judge. Evaluate each with-agent run on 3 dimensions.

### Dimension 1: Dispatch Accuracy (0–10)
- Correct dispatch decision (dispatches/withholds matches expected) → 10
- Dispatched with hesitation, or failed to dispatch confidently → 5
- Dispatched on a negative case, or failed on a direct case → 0

Check programmatically first: did an `Agent` tool call with this agent's `name` field appear in the transcript? Use LLM judgment only for borderline cases.

### Dimension 2: Workflow Completion (0–10)
Count numbered steps in the agent's body.  
Score = (steps completed correctly / total steps) × 10

### Dimension 3: Output Correctness (0–10)
Compare actual output against the `assertions` array in the eval:
- All assertions met → 10
- Minor omissions or imprecisions → 7–9
- Key elements missing → 4–6
- Wrong output → 0–3

### Dimension 4: Project Fit (0–10) — project-native, project-workflow, and multi-turn only
- Output uses project-specific terminology correctly → 4 pts
- Output references the correct project artifact paths → 3 pts
- Output aligns with the project's installed agent ecosystem (no conflicts, correct handoffs) → 3 pts

**Base composite = (Dispatch × 0.4) + (Workflow × 0.3) + (Output × 0.3)**  
**Project composite = (Dispatch × 0.35) + (Workflow × 0.25) + (Output × 0.25) + (ProjectFit × 0.15)**  
**Project Fit Score** = average of Dimension 4 scores across project-native + project-workflow + multi-turn.

### Special scoring rules

**Adversarial scenarios (type: adversarial, expected dispatches: false):**  
Do NOT apply the base composite formula. Score is binary:
- **10** — agent correctly did NOT dispatch AND gave a useful redirect or neutral response
- **0** — agent incorrectly dispatched on a wrong-scope prompt

No partial credit. A score of 0 on any adversarial scenario is an immediate `ADVERSARIAL_FAILURE` flag.

**Multi-turn scenarios (type: multi-turn, expected dispatches: true):**  
Apply the project composite formula, then apply one deduction:
- **−3 pts** if the agent re-asked for any information already present in the "[Continuing from earlier]" preamble

**Resilience Score** = (adversarial scenarios scoring > 0) / total adversarial × 10. Target ≥ 8/10.

## Analyst Pass Checklist

After grading all runs, check for:

- [ ] **Non-discriminating assertions** — scenarios that pass both with-agent and without-agent (agent adds no value here)
- [ ] **Flaky dispatch** — scenarios that dispatched 1 or 2 out of 3 reps (description is unstable)
- [ ] **Baseline delta** — is the with-agent output meaningfully better than general capabilities? If not, the agent may be redundant
- [ ] **Token cost vs. benefit** — high-footprint agents should show proportionally larger baseline delta
- [ ] **Project terminology mismatch** — project-native scenario dispatched but output used generic language instead of project terms
- [ ] **Ecosystem conflict** — project-workflow scenario shows agent duplicating or contradicting output from a sibling agent
- [ ] **Adversarial failure** — adversarial scenario scored 0 (agent over-dispatched; description too broad → Lever A)
- [ ] **Multi-turn redundancy** — multi-turn scenario lost 3 pts for re-asking context already given (→ Lever B)
- [ ] **Tool violation** — agent used a tool not in its frontmatter `tools:` list (→ TOOL_VIOLATION flag; fix via Lever E)
