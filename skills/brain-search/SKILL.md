# Brain Search

## Workflow
1. Distill the user's question into 2–5 search terms.
2. Run: `node scripts/brain/brain-search.js --query "<terms>" --json --limit 8`
3. Present hits grouped by authority (canon first), each with title, path, and a one-line gist from reading the file. State the authority level explicitly — a session note is a hint, canon is law.
4. Zero hits: say so plainly and suggest related terms; never invent brain content.
5. If the user acts on a canon/active item, remind that changes go through candidates + brain-promote.

## Files it may edit — none (read-only skill).
## Success criteria — answers cite capsule paths; authority always labeled; no fabricated memory.
