name: agent-adapt
description: "Adapts a security-audited Claude Code agent definition to match a specific project's conventions, model tier preferences, tool scope, and domain terminology. Use when adapting an agent for a project, customizing an agent definition, installing an agent after agent-audit returns PASS, or when synthesizing multiple candidate agents into one project-native agent."
compatibility: "Claude Code."

# Agent Adapt

Rewrite a sourced agent definition so it fits your project like a native agent — not a transplant.

## Prerequisite

`agent-audit` must have returned **PASS** on every source before calling this. Never adapt a BLOCK or unaudited agent.

## Workflow

1. **Load source agent(s)** — read the candidate agent `.md` (full content) for every audited candidate. If multiple candidates passed audit, go to step 2. If only one, skip to step 3.

2. **Multi-source synthesis** (2+ candidates only) — compare candidates on:
   - Role clarity: which has the clearest description and "Use when" triggers?
   - Tool minimalism: which requests the fewest tools for the same role?
   - Model appropriateness: which declares the right model tier for the task?
   - Body quality: which has the cleaner workflow and "What NOT to Do" constraints?

   Choose one as the primary source. Extract specific sections (role scope, workflow steps, constraints) from secondary sources to fill gaps. Record which source each element came from — goes into the provenance block in step 6.

3. **Load project context** — read `evals/project-context.json` if it exists. Extract: `stack`, `workflow_terms`, `key_phrases`, `installed_skills`, `ref_agents`. These signals drive the adaptation in the next steps.

4. **Adapt the description** — rewrite the agent's `description:` field using project-specific terminology and trigger phrases that match how this project's users speak. Keep role scope tight. Target ≤ 1024 chars (Agent Skills spec limit).

5. **Adapt agent metadata fields**:
   - `model`: align with the project's preferred model tier:
     - Lightweight tasks (summarise, classify, extract) → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
     - Reasoning tasks (plan, review, debug) → `claude-sonnet-4-6`
     - Complex orchestration (multi-step research, architecture) → `claude-opus-4-8`
     - If no project preference, keep the source model.
   - `color`: assign a color consistent with any project color convention; if none exists, keep the source color or omit.
   - `tools`: trim to the minimum the role requires. Add project-specific MCP tools only if the role genuinely needs them. Never add tools absent from the source without explicit user approval.

6. **Adapt body** — align the agent's workflow steps and constraints with project conventions:
   - Replace generic terminology with project domain terms from `workflow_terms` and `key_phrases`
   - Add a "What NOT to Do" section if the source doesn't have one
   - Remove steps that don't apply to this project's context

7. **Add provenance block** — add a `metadata:` block to the frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   metadata:
     source_url: <GitHub URL>
     source_commit: <40-char commit hash>
     audit_verdict: PASS
     adapted_for: <project name>
     adapted_date: YYYY-MM-DD
   ```
   For multi-source adaptations, include all source URLs.

8. **Write the adapted agent** — write to `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/agents
   ```

9. **Conflict check** — compare the new description against installed agents: `ls .claude/agents/`. If role overlap > 50% with an existing agent, propose a more specific description or ask the user whether to replace.

10. **Report** — summarise: what was adapted from which source, what was changed (model, tools, description, body), what was removed, and why.

## Adaptation rules

- Never remove the source commit hash — needed for upstream version checking.
- Never expand the tools list beyond what the source had without explicit user approval.
- One agent per file — do not merge multiple agent roles into one definition.
- Keep agent files concise — an agent definition should rarely exceed 150 lines.
