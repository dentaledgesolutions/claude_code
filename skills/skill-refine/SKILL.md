name: skill-refine
description: Auto-improves a Claude Code skill using Karpathy's autoresearch loop — baseline eval, targeted mutation, re-measure, keep or revert. Produces a delta report. Use when refining a skill, improving a skill, running autoresearch on a skill, or when skill-eval reports pass rate below threshold.

# Skill Refine

Apply Karpathy's autoresearch loop to measurably improve a skill. Diagnose → targeted fix → verified improvement. No guessing, no rewrites.

## Prerequisite

`skill-eval` must have run first. You need a baseline and a `refine-input.json`. If neither exists, run `skill-eval` now.

## The Loop

```
RULE:    One lever per iteration. Score ↑ (>+2%) → keep. Score ↓ (>−5%) → revert. Repeat.
TARGET:  eval_pass_rate ≥ 80%  AND  trigger_accuracy ≥ 85%
BUDGET:  default 10 iterations, stop early at 95%+ for 3 consecutive
```

## Workflow

1. **Gather inputs** — load `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL-EVAL.md` and `evals/<skill-name>/refine-input.json` (the structured handoff from skill-eval). Confirm budget and runs-per-experiment with the user (default: 10 iterations, 3 reps each).

2. **Back up and validate baseline** — copy the current skill before touching anything:
   ```bash
   cp skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md.baseline
   ```
   Then check staleness: if `refine-input.json` was written today **and** `SKILL.md` has not been modified since — trust the baseline scores directly, no re-run needed. If the skill was changed since eval ran, re-run only the failing scenarios (3 reps, same parallel subagent pattern as skill-eval) to refresh the baseline before proceeding. If baseline is already ≥ 90%, ask the user whether to continue.

3. **Route by failing metric** — the correct lever depends on *which* metric is failing:
   - **Project Fit Score < 7** → do not refine. Exit and re-run `skill-adapt` with a richer `evals/project-context.json`. Refining won't fix a mis-adapted skill.
   - **Trigger Accuracy < 85%** → work Lever A (description) only this session. Don't touch B–E until triggers are stable.
   - **Eval Pass Rate < 80%** (triggers fine) → work Levers B–E.
   - **Both failing** → fix Lever A first; pass rate issues are often downstream of trigger instability.

4. **Train/test split** — treat the failing scenarios from `refine-input.json` as the *training set* (mutate against these). Hold the `project-native` and `project-workflow` scenarios as the *validation set* (run only on final validation, not during iterations). This prevents overfitting the skill to its own eval suite.

5. **Hypothesis** — pick ONE change from the lever space. Consult the failure mode → lever table in REFERENCE.md. Track which levers have been tried this session (coverage) — in early iterations, vary lever types; in later iterations, exploit the best-performing lever.

6. **Mutate** — make exactly the targeted edit. No other changes.

7. **Re-eval (training set only)** — re-run the failing scenarios using skill-eval's exact methodology: parallel subagents (with-skill vs baseline snapshot), 3 reps each, programmatic trigger detection first, then LLM judge scoring using the rubric in skill-eval's REFERENCE.md. Also run 1 rep of each previously-passing scenario as a regression check. Use the same scoring formula: `(Trigger × 0.4) + (Checklist × 0.3) + (Output × 0.3)`.

8. **Keep or revert** (see thresholds in REFERENCE.md):
   - Improved → **KEEP**. Sync to runtime: `cp -r skills/<skill-name> ~/.claude/skills/`
   - Regressed or neutral → **REVERT** to prior content exactly.
   - Log the iteration either way — failed hypotheses are data.

9. **Repeat** steps 5–8 until any convergence criterion is met (see REFERENCE.md).

10. **Final validation** — invoke `skill-eval` on the improved skill. Do not implement a separate eval process — skill-eval IS the final validation. This produces a new `SKILL-EVAL.md` replacing the old one, giving a clean before/after comparison on identical methodology. The held-out `project-native` and `project-workflow` scenarios run here for the first time during this refinement session.

11. **Write report** — save `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL-REFINE-LOG.md` using the template in REFERENCE.md. If claude-mem is installed, persist a summary there too.

## Rules

- **One lever per iteration** — never change description AND checklist in the same iteration.
- **Revert faithfully** — restore the exact prior content, not a rewrite of it.
- **Log every iteration** — including failed hypotheses. They're data.
- **Don't rewrite** — if pass rate < 40% after 5 iterations, recommend `write-a-skill` instead.
- **Never skip the baseline backup** — `SKILL.md.baseline` must exist before the first mutation.

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for lever definitions, keep/revert thresholds, hypothesis guide, good/bad mutations, convergence criteria, and log template.
