# Skill Refine Reference

## Routing Guide — Which Metric → Which Lever

| Failing metric | Root cause | Action |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Project Fit Score < 7 | Skill wasn't adapted to project context | **Exit: re-run skill-adapt** with richer project-context.json |
| Trigger Accuracy < 85% | Description doesn't match how users phrase requests | **Lever A only** — don't touch B–E until triggers are stable |
| Eval Pass Rate < 80%, triggers fine | Skill fires but executes incorrectly | **Levers B–E** |
| Both trigger + pass rate failing | Trigger instability cascades to execution failures | **Lever A first**, then B–E |

---

## Keep / Revert Thresholds

| Outcome | Condition | Decision |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **KEEP** | pass_rate > baseline + 2% | This is the new baseline |
| **REVERT** | pass_rate < baseline − 5% | Restore exact prior content |
| **NEUTRAL → KEEP** | Within ±2–5% | Keep — slight preference for new; simpler isn't worse |

A neutral result that makes the skill *shorter* is a win. Simplification that maintains the score reduces context footprint.

## Lever Space

**Lever A — Description wording** (trigger precision)
The `description:` frontmatter. Changes what prompts activate the skill.
- Constraint: keep "Use when [X]" format, ≤ 200 chars
- High-impact: one word change can shift trigger accuracy by 20%+

**Lever B — Checklist step** (completeness / ordering)
Any numbered step in `## Workflow`. Changes what Claude does when active.
- Constraint: one step at a time, never reorder all steps at once

**Lever C — Examples** (clarity for ambiguous input)
Content under `## Quick start` or inline examples.
- Constraint: examples must reflect real usage, not idealized scenarios

**Lever D — Reference content** (depth for edge cases)
Content in REFERENCE.md. Changes lookup information depth.
- Constraint: don't move core workflow into REFERENCE.md

**Lever E — Script logic** (deterministic behavior)
Code in `scripts/`. Changes deterministic output.
- Constraint: run `static-scan.js` after any script edit

## Good vs Bad Mutations

**Good mutations:**
- Add a specific instruction addressing the most common failure pattern
- Reword an ambiguous instruction to be more explicit
- Add an anti-pattern ("Do NOT do X") for a recurring mistake
- Move a buried instruction higher (priority = position in file)
- Add or improve an example showing the correct behavior
- Remove an instruction causing over-optimization for one thing at the expense of others
- Add a trigger synonym the description was missing

**Bad mutations:**
- Rewriting the entire skill from scratch
- Adding multiple rules in one iteration
- Making the skill longer without a specific reason
- Adding vague instructions like "be more careful" or "do better"
- Changing both description and a workflow step in the same iteration

## Hypothesis Generation Guide

When a scenario fails, map the failure to a lever:

| Failure mode | Lever | Example hypothesis |
|-------------|-------|--------------------|
| Skill didn't trigger | A | Add "search for skill" to trigger list |
| Triggered on a negative | A | Narrow description: add "installed skill" qualifier |
| Step was skipped | B | Add explicit output requirement to step N |
| Output was incomplete | C | Add example showing complete output format |
| Edge case not handled | D | Add edge case section to REFERENCE.md |
| Script returned wrong format | E | Fix JSON schema in script output |
| Project terminology missing from output | A or B | Add project terms to description or step instructions |

**Coverage tracking** — note which lever type was used each iteration. In early iterations, vary lever types (explore). Once a lever shows consistent improvement, focus on it (exploit).

## Convergence Criteria

Stop the loop when ANY of:

1. `eval_pass_rate ≥ 80%` AND `trigger_accuracy ≥ 85%` → **DONE**
2. `pass_rate ≥ 95%` for 3 consecutive experiments → **DONE** (diminishing returns)
3. Budget exhausted with no improvement in last 2 iterations → **DONE**
4. All generated hypotheses have been tested → **DONE**
5. `eval_pass_rate < 40%` after 5 iterations → **REWRITE** — recommend `write-a-skill`
6. Project Fit Score < 7 at routing step → **RE-ADAPT** — do not enter refinement loop

## SKILL-REFINE-LOG.md Template

Save to `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL-REFINE-LOG.md`.

```markdown
# Skill Refinement Log: <skill-name>
**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Baseline:** pass_rate=XX%, trigger_accuracy=XX%, project_fit=X/10  
**Target:** pass_rate ≥ 80%, trigger_accuracy ≥ 85%  
**Training set:** <N> failing scenarios from refine-input.json  
**Held-out set:** project-native, project-workflow scenarios  

## Iterations

### Iteration 1
- **Hypothesis:** Changing [section] will improve [scenario name] because [reason]
- **Lever:** A/B/C/D/E — [what type of change]
- **Change:** [one-line summary]
- **Before:** pass_rate=XX%, trigger_accuracy=XX%
- **After:** pass_rate=XX%, trigger_accuracy=XX%
- **Decision:** KEPT / REVERTED / NEUTRAL-KEPT
- **Note:** [why it worked or didn't]

## Final Results

| Metric | Baseline | Final | Delta |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|
| Eval Pass Rate | XX% | XX% | +/-XX% |
| Trigger Accuracy | XX% | XX% | +/-XX% |
| Project Fit Score | X/10 | X/10 | +/-X |
| Context Footprint | XXL | XXL | +/-XXL |
| Iterations run | — | N | — |
| Keep rate | — | X/N | — |

**Levers used:** A(N), B(N), C(N), D(N), E(N)  
**Most effective lever:** [letter] — [what worked]  
**Failed hypotheses:** [list — data for future sessions]  

**Recommendation:** DONE / NEEDS-REWRITE / CONTINUE / RE-ADAPT
```

## Cross-Session Persistence

After each refinement session, record a summary. Use claude-mem if installed:

```
Skill: <skill-name>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Iterations: N (kept: X, reverted: Y)
Baseline → Final: pass_rate XX%→XX%, trigger_accuracy XX%→XX%
Effective levers: [list]
Failed hypotheses: [list]
Untested hypotheses remaining: [list — pick up here next session]
```

If claude-mem is not installed, `SKILL-REFINE-LOG.md` is the persistent record — future sessions start by reading it.
