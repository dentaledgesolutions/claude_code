# Agent Scout

Find the best existing Claude Code agent definition for a capability rather than building one from scratch.

## Quick start

```
User: find an agent for code review
User: is there a Claude agent that can run parallel web searches?
User: source an agent for data extraction
```

## Workflow

0. **Pre-flight: check project context** — before asking the user anything:
   - Check if `evals/project-context.json` exists and read it if so
   - If `ref_agents` is non-empty, use it as a warm-start shortlist — these are agent names already known from reference projects. Mention them upfront: *"Your reference projects had these agents: [list]. Want me to search for any of these, or a different capability?"*
   - Use `stack` values as additional keyword signals in the GitHub search

   **If `evals/project-context.json` is missing:** tell the user:
   > "Your project context isn't configured yet. Run `/project-setup` first to get project-tailored results. Or I can search generically right now."

1. **Capture the need** — ask: "What should this agent do?" If the need was already surfaced from `ref_agents`, confirm or redirect. One question at a time.

2. **Search GitHub** — search for agent definitions using WebSearch:
   - `site:github.com path:.claude/agents filename:.md <capability>`
   - `site:github.com "claude code" agent <capability> ".claude/agents"`
   - `github.com/search?type=code&q=path:.claude/agents+<capability>`

   If one query returns nothing, try alternative terms (e.g., "search" → "discovery", "review" → "audit").

3. **Fetch candidates** — WebFetch the raw agent `.md` for each candidate. Collect: name, description, model declared, tools list, body text, line count, repo age in days, star count, source org.

4. **Score candidates** — evaluate each on these dimensions:

   | Dimension | Weight | What to measure |
   |-----------|--------|----------------|
   | Role clarity | 25% | Does the description clearly state what the agent does and when to use it? |
   | Tool minimalism | 20% | Does the tool list match the role? Fewer tools = better (principle of least privilege) |
   | Model appropriateness | 20% | Is the declared model right for the task? (haiku for lightweight, sonnet for reasoning, opus for complex) |
   | Project fit | 20% | Keyword overlap with project `stack` and `key_phrases` |
   | Provenance | 10% | Repo age + stars (penalize <30 days; reward ≥100 stars) |
   | Conflict risk | 5% | Role overlap with agents already in `.claude/agents/` |

   **Total score = weighted average × 10**

5. **Conflict check** — list installed agents: `ls .claude/agents/ 2>/dev/null`. Flag any candidate whose role heavily overlaps with an already-installed agent.

6. **Present top 3** — for each candidate show:

   ```
   1. <agent-name>  (score: N/10 — STRONG | GOOD | MARGINAL)
      <one-line description>
      Model: <declared model>  Tools: <tools list>
      Source: github.com/<org>/<repo>@<commit-hash>  ★ <stars>
      Trade-off: <one sentence>
   ```

   Then ask: *"Would you like to audit the top pick, or audit the top 2–3 so agent-adapt can synthesize the best elements from each?"*

7. **Hand off to agent-audit** — invoke `agent-audit` on every candidate the user selects. Run audits sequentially.

   - Any **BLOCK** verdict: remove that candidate, tell the user why.
   - Any **FLAG** verdict: present findings and ask for explicit confirmation before keeping it.
   - Any **PASS** verdict: keep in the set.

   Pass all PASS candidates to `agent-adapt`. If more than one PASS candidate exists, tell the user: *"agent-adapt will synthesize the best elements from all [N] candidates."*

8. **No results fallback** — if no candidate scores > 5:
   - Tell the user no suitable agent was found.
   - Offer to help define a custom agent definition inline.

## Rules

- Always pin the source commit hash in your recommendation (never just a branch name).
- Never write any files — that's agent-adapt's job (after agent-audit clears the candidate).
- Prefer agents from trusted source orgs; explicitly flag unknown authors with low stars.
- Never recommend an agent with more tools than its role requires — tool scope is a security signal.
