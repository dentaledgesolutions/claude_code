name: team-eval
description: "Use when: evaluating an agent team or multi-agent orchestration end-to-end, measuring dispatch-chain accuracy or handoff integrity, checking whether an orchestrator uses its member agents correctly, or auditing an ensemble like the repo-audit analysts as a unit. Evaluates the ORCHESTRATION (orchestrator + members together), not any single definition — for one skill use skill-eval, for one agent use agent-eval. Requires a team.json manifest. Triggers on: evaluate the team, team eval, test the orchestration, check the ensemble, dispatch-chain accuracy, handoff integrity."

# Team Eval

Evaluate an agent team — an orchestrator plus the member agents it dispatches — as a single unit.
Per-definition evals (skill-eval, agent-eval) never exercise member selection, handoffs, or
ensemble degradation; this skill fills that blind spot.

## Quick start

```
User: evaluate the repo-audit-ensemble team
User: run a team eval on the repo-audit analysts
User: check whether the orchestration dispatches its members correctly
```

## The team manifest (team.json)

Every team eval starts from a committed manifest. Reference example:
`fixtures/teams/repo-audit-ensemble/team.json`.

```json
{
  "team_name": "repo-audit-ensemble",
  "description": "what the orchestration does",
  "orchestrator": { "type": "skill", "name": "repo-audit" },
  "members": [ { "agent": "repo-audit-runtime", "role": "runtime layer" } ],
  "handoff_contract": "what each member receives and must return",
  "expected_artifacts": ["docs/audits/"],
  "example_target": "https://github.com/expressjs/express"
}
```

All fields are required (members non-empty; every `members[].agent` must exist at
`.claude/agents/<agent>.md`; the orchestrator at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or
`.claude/agents/<name>.md`).

## Workflow

1. **Load the manifest** — read team.json, the orchestrator definition, and every member
   definition in full. Aggregate context footprint = total lines across orchestrator + all member
   definitions × 4 estimated tokens/line.

2. **Generate scenarios**:
   `node skills/team-eval/scripts/generate-team-evals.js <team.json> --context evals/project-context.json`
   Writes 6 scenarios to `evals/teams/<team_name>/evals.json`:

   | Type | Dispatches? | Tests |
   |------|-------------|-------|
   | `full-run` | ✓ all members | end-to-end orchestration + final artifact |
   | `partial-team` | ✓ subset | only the requested members run |
   | `member-failure` | ✓ all minus one | graceful degradation, no fabricated layer |
   | `handoff-integrity` | ✓ all | member outputs consumed, not re-derived |
   | `negative` | ✗ | describe the team without dispatching it |
   | `adversarial` | ✗ | team vocabulary, wrong scope — must not dispatch |

3. **Execute scenarios** — one orchestrator run per scenario, executed by this Claude session
   (never auto-executed by a script; team runs spawn many subagents and are deliberately
   human-invoked). For each scenario, run the orchestrator against the scenario prompt with all
   artifacts rooted at `evals/teams/<team_name>/iteration-<N>/s<id>-<type>/run/` (workspace
   sandbox + output.md transcript, same layout as skill-eval scenario sides). The transcript MUST
   record each real member dispatch with the literal token `Agent(<member-name>)` — the same
   invocation-token contract as agent-eval; narrative mentions never count.

4. **Harvest evidence** — the existing harvester consumes team evidence unchanged:
   `node skills/skill-eval/scripts/harvest-evidence.js evals/teams/<team_name>/iteration-<N> --type agent --all`

5. **Grade evidence-first** — per scenario:
   - **Dispatch-chain correctness comes ONLY from evidence.json's `transcript_markers` array** —
     every member marker must match its `expect` (present/absent). Never use the single
     `agent_dispatched` boolean for team grading: it reflects only the first marker.
   - LLM-judge score (0–10) against the scenario's `expected.judgment` items plus output quality.
   - Composite = (dispatch-chain-correct ratio × 0.4) + (judgment/output × 0.4) + (artifact
     evidence × 0.2). Negative/adversarial are binary: 10 if zero members dispatched and the
     response was useful, 0 if any member dispatched.

6. **Compute 5 metrics**:

   | Metric | Definition | Threshold |
   |--------|------------|-----------|
   | Team Pass Rate | scenarios with composite ≥ 7 / total | ≥ 80% |
   | Dispatch-Chain Accuracy | correct member dispatch decisions / total member-checks | ≥ 85% |
   | Handoff Integrity | verifiably consumed member outputs / expected handoffs | ≥ 90% |
   | Aggregate Context Footprint | orchestrator + member definitions, lines / est. tokens | informational |
   | Team Resilience | negative + adversarial correctly not dispatching / total × 10 | ≥ 8/10 |

7. **Write the report** to `evals/teams/<team_name>/TEAM-EVAL.md` (same table format family as
   SKILL-EVAL.md), with per-scenario results and analyst observations.

8. **Below threshold?** Write `evals/teams/<team_name>/refine-input.json` routing to the
   ORCHESTRATOR's refine track (skill-refine for a skill orchestrator, agent-refine for an agent
   one). There is no team-refine — member definitions are refined individually via agent-refine
   when member-level defects are implicated.

## What NOT to Do

- Never evaluate a single skill/agent with this — that's skill-eval / agent-eval.
- Never auto-execute team scenarios from a script — execution is session-driven and human-invoked.
- Never mutate member or orchestrator definitions during an eval.
- Never grade dispatch-chain accuracy from the `agent_dispatched` boolean or from narrative
  mentions — only the full `transcript_markers` evidence counts.
- Never skip members in the manifest — every member carries a marker in every scenario.
