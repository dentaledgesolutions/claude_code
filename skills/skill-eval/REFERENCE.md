# Skill Eval Reference

## Scenario Types

Generate one of each type. Named evals are easier to track than "eval-0".

| # | Type | Expected trigger | Description | Example |
|---|------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | `direct` | ✓ | Exact trigger phrase from description | `"evaluate the skill-adapt skill"` |
| 2 | `paraphrased` | ✓ | Same intent, different words | `"check how well skill-adapt is working"` |
| 3 | `edge_case` | ✓ | Unusual but valid — starts mid-workflow or uses minimal input | `"I already adapted the skill, just run the checklist"` |
| 4 | `negative` | ✗ | Should NOT trigger — explanation request | `"describe how skill-adapt works"` (explain, not invoke) |
| 5 | `semantic` | ✓ | Synonym variation of the action verb | `"measure" / "benchmark" / "test"` for "evaluate" |
| 6 | `adversarial` | ✗ | Skill vocabulary in wrong scope or adjacent pipeline stage — must NOT fire | `"evaluate my React components"` (eval is for skills, not components) |
| 7 | `project-native` | ✓ | Uses project-specific terminology, stack, and artifact paths | `"evaluate skill-adapt for our Next.js/GSD project — outputs go in .planning/"` |
| 8 | `project-workflow` | ✓ | Tests skill within the context of the project's installed skill ecosystem | `"After running skill-audit, now evaluate skill-adapt"` |
| 9 | `multi-turn` | ✓ | Mid-session continuation framing — tests skill outside cold-start conditions | `"[Continuing from earlier] We agreed I'd evaluate skill-adapt. Let's do that now."` |

The first 6 types are always generated. Types 7–9 require `--context evals/project-context.json`.

**Repetitions:** Run trigger-type scenarios (direct, paraphrased, semantic, negative, adversarial) 3 times each — consistency across reps reveals description instability. Run non-trigger scenarios (edge_case, project-native, project-workflow, multi-turn) once per side — they test workflow quality, not trigger reliability.

## LLM Judge Rubric

Use a faster/cheaper model (e.g., Haiku) as judge. Evaluate each with-skill run on 3 dimensions.

### Dimension 1: Trigger Accuracy (0–10)
- Correct trigger decision (yes/no matches expected) → 10
- Triggered but with hesitation, or failed to trigger confidently → 5
- Triggered on a negative case, or failed on a direct case → 0

Check programmatically first: did the skill tool call appear in the transcript? Use LLM judgment only for borderline cases.

### Dimension 2: Checklist Completion (0–10)
Count numbered workflow steps in SKILL.md.  
Score = (steps completed correctly / total steps) × 10

### Dimension 3: Output Correctness (0–10)
Compare actual output against the `assertions` array in the eval:
- All assertions met → 10
- Minor omissions or imprecisions → 7–9
- Key elements missing → 4–6
- Wrong output → 0–3

### Dimension 4: Project Fit (0–10) — project-native, project-workflow, and multi-turn scenarios only
- Output uses project-specific terminology correctly → 4 pts
- Output references the correct project artifact paths → 3 pts
- Output aligns with the project's installed skill ecosystem (no conflicts, correct handoffs) → 3 pts

**Base scenario score = (Trigger × 0.4) + (Checklist × 0.3) + (Output × 0.3)**  
**Project scenario score = (Trigger × 0.35) + (Checklist × 0.25) + (Output × 0.25) + (ProjectFit × 0.15)**  
**Project Fit Score** = average of Dimension 4 scores across project-native + project-workflow + multi-turn scenarios.

### Special scoring rules

**Adversarial scenarios (type: adversarial, expected triggers: false):**  
Do NOT apply the base composite formula. Score is binary:
- **10** — skill correctly did NOT invoke its workflow AND gave a useful redirect or neutral response
- **0** — skill incorrectly invoked its full workflow on a wrong-scope prompt

No partial credit. A score of 0 on any adversarial scenario is an immediate `ADVERSARIAL_FAILURE` flag.

**Multi-turn scenarios (type: multi-turn, expected triggers: true):**  
Apply the project scenario composite formula, then apply one deduction:
- **−3 pts** if the skill re-asked for any information already present in the "[Continuing from earlier]" preamble (e.g. re-asked for project name, stack, or any detail stated in the simulated prior context)

**Resilience Score** = (adversarial scenarios scoring > 0) / total adversarial × 10. Target ≥ 8/10.

Trigger accuracy is weighted highest — a skill nobody triggers correctly has no value regardless of execution quality. Project Fit Score below 7 means skill-adapt should be re-run with richer project context before proceeding. Resilience Score below 8 means the description is too broad — route to Lever A.

## Analyst Pass Checklist

After grading all runs, check for:

- [ ] **Non-discriminating assertions** — scenarios that pass both with-skill and without-skill (skill adds no value here)
- [ ] **Flaky triggers** — scenarios that triggered in 1 or 2 out of 3 reps (description is unstable)
- [ ] **Baseline delta** — is the with-skill output meaningfully better than no-skill? If not, the skill may be redundant
- [ ] **Token cost vs. benefit** — high context footprint skills should show proportionally larger baseline delta
- [ ] **Project terminology mismatch** — project-native scenario triggered but output used generic language instead of project terms
- [ ] **Ecosystem conflict** — project-workflow scenario shows skill duplicating or contradicting output from a sibling skill
- [ ] **Missing artifact references** — output doesn't reference project paths (`.planning/`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.) that it should know about
- [ ] **Adversarial failure** — adversarial scenario scored 0 (skill over-triggered on wrong-scope prompt; description too broad → Lever A)
- [ ] **Multi-turn redundancy** — multi-turn scenario lost 3 pts for re-asking context already given in the preamble (→ Lever B)
