name: skill-adapt
description: Adapts a security-audited skill to match a specific project's patterns, terminology, workflow gates, and installed skill ecosystem. Use when adapting a skill for a project, customizing a skill, modifying a skill to fit a project's workflow, after skill-audit returns PASS, or when synthesizing multiple candidate skills into one project-native skill.

# Skill Adapt

Rewrite a sourced skill so it fits your project like a native skill — not a transplant.

## Prerequisite

`skill-audit` must have returned **PASS** on every source before calling this. Never adapt a BLOCK or unaudited skill.

## Workflow

1. **Load source skill(s)** — read the SKILL.md (and REFERENCE.md if present) for every audited candidate. If multiple candidates passed audit, go to step 2. If only one, skip to step 3.

2. **Multi-source synthesis** (2+ candidates only) — compare candidates on these dimensions:
   - Trigger precision: which has the clearest "Use when" triggers?
   - Workflow completeness: which covers the most necessary steps?
   - Project alignment: which uses terminology closest to this project?
   - Structural quality: which has the better REFERENCE.md / scripts separation?

   Choose one as the primary source (highest combined fit). Extract specific steps or patterns from secondary sources to fill its gaps. Record which source each element came from — this goes into the provenance record in step 7.

3. **Load project context** — check if `evals/project-context.json` already exists. If it does, read it directly — this is the canonical structured context for this project and ensures skill-eval tests against the same data this adaptation used.

   If it doesn't exist, generate it first:
   ```bash
   node skills/skill-eval/scripts/extract-project-context.js
   ```
   Then read `evals/project-context.json`. Supplement with a quick scan of the raw source files if anything looks missing (the script may miss hand-written conventions in `CLAUDE.md` or `.planning/` that require reading in full).

   From `project-context.json`, extract: `stack`, `workflow_terms`, `key_phrases`, `artifact_paths`, `installed_skills`, `hooks`, `mcp_servers`, `plugins`. These are the exact fields skill-eval will later test against — adapting from this data closes the loop.

   Use the three new fields as constraints when adapting workflow steps:
   - **`hooks`**: if a `PostToolUse` hook already runs a formatter, linter, or test command that matches what the skill would do, remove the redundant step from the adapted workflow. If a `PreToolUse` hook guards a tool (e.g. `Bash`), note this as a constraint in the skill's Rules section.
   - **`mcp_servers`**: if the skill assumes an external integration (e.g. GitHub PR creation, JIRA ticket updates), confirm the relevant MCP name appears in this list. If not, add a prerequisite note in the skill's Prerequisite section.
   - **`plugins`**: if the skill's core capability is already provided by an installed plugin, flag a potential conflict — same logic as the `installed_skills` overlap check.

4. **Snapshot existing skill** — if a skill with this name is already installed, back it up before touching anything:
   ```bash
   cp -r skills/<skill-name> skills/<skill-name>-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

5. **Adapt the description** — rewrite the `description:` frontmatter using project-specific terminology and "pushy" trigger phrases: include the exact words a user would say to activate this skill. Keep "Use when [X]" format. Target ≤ 1024 chars (Agent Skills spec limit).

6. **Adapt workflow steps** — align steps with project conventions:
   - GSD projects: map to GSD phase gates (discuss → plan → execute → verify)
   - Custom projects: match step naming and artifact conventions
   - Remove steps that don't apply; add project-specific steps where needed
   - See REFERENCE.md for what's allowed vs. forbidden to change

7. **Add provenance record** — add a `metadata:` block to frontmatter (Agent Skills spec standard field):
   ```yaml
   metadata:
     source_url: <GitHub URL>
     source_commit: <40-char commit hash>
     adapted_for: <project name>
     adapted_date: YYYY-MM-DD
     project_context_source: evals/project-context.json
     license: <license from source skill, or omit if unknown>
   ```
   `project_context_source` pins which context file shaped this adaptation — skill-eval reads it from there. For multi-source adaptations, include all sources. See REFERENCE.md for the full template.

8. **Write the adapted skill** — write to `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. Adapt REFERENCE.md and scripts/ only if they need project-specific examples or paths; never change their core logic.

9. **Agent dependency detection** — scan the adapted SKILL.md for agent dependencies:
   - Search the body for tokens ending in `-agent` (e.g., `skill-eval-agent`) and phrases like `dispatch a subagent`, `invoke … agent`, `spawn … agent`
   - For each agent name found, check whether it exists in `.claude/agents/`:
     ```bash
     ls .claude/agents/ 2>/dev/null
     ```
   - If an agent is missing, warn before proceeding:
     > "This skill depends on `<agent-name>` which is not in `.claude/agents/`. Run `/agent-scout` to find and install it, or continue without it — the skill will fail at the step that invokes it."
   - If all agents are present, continue silently.

10. **Sync to runtime** — copy to the global skills directory so Claude Code can use it immediately:
    ```bash
    cp -r skills/<skill-name> ~/.claude/skills/
    ```

11. **Conflict check** — compare the new description against installed skills: `ls skills/`. If trigger overlap > 50% with an existing skill, propose a more specific description or ask the user whether to replace.

12. **Validate** — run the checklist in REFERENCE.md. Fix any failures before proceeding.

13. **Test the trigger** — give 2-3 realistic user prompts that should activate this skill. Verify the description routes those prompts correctly. If not, sharpen the description and re-test.

14. **Report** — summarise: what was adapted from which source, what was removed, what was added, and why.

## Adaptation rules

- Keep SKILL.md concise — move detail to REFERENCE.md. Body content should be 1,500–2,000 words at most.
- Never remove the source commit hash — needed for upstream version checking.
- One skill per directory — don't merge multiple skills into one file.
- Never change script logic or scoring thresholds — only adapt framing, triggers, and step names.

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the validation checklist, provenance template, and allowed/forbidden changes table.
