# Agent Refine Reference

## Routing Guide — Which Metric → Which Lever

| Failing metric | Root cause | Action |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Project Fit Score < 7 (project-native or project-workflow failed) | Agent wasn't adapted to project context | **Exit: re-run agent-adapt** with richer project-context.json |
| Project Fit Score < 7 (ONLY multi-turn failed) | Agent re-asks established context | **Lever B** — add continuation-awareness note; do NOT exit to agent-adapt |
| Resilience Score < 8/10 | Description too broad — dispatches on wrong-scope prompts | **Lever A only** — tighten trigger conditions; add negative examples ("not when X") |
| Dispatch Accuracy < 85% | Description doesn't match how orchestrators phrase requests | **Lever A only** — don't touch B–E until dispatch is stable |
| Eval Pass Rate < 80%, dispatch and resilience fine | Agent dispatches but executes incorrectly | **Levers B–E** |
| Multiple metrics failing | Dispatch/resilience instability cascades to execution failures | **Lever A first**, then B–E |

## Keep / Revert Thresholds

| Outcome | Condition | Decision |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **KEEP** | pass_rate > baseline + 2% | This is the new baseline |
| **REVERT** | pass_rate < baseline − 5% | Restore exact prior content |
| **NEUTRAL → KEEP** | Within ±2–5% | Keep — slight preference for new; simpler isn't worse |

A neutral result that makes the agent file *shorter* is a win. Simplification that maintains the score reduces context footprint.

## Lever Space

**Lever A — Description wording** (dispatch precision)
The `description:` frontmatter field. Changes what prompts cause Claude to dispatch this agent.
- Constraint: keep "Use when [X]" format, ≤ 1024 chars
- High-impact: one word change can shift dispatch accuracy by 20%+

**Lever B — Workflow step** (completeness / ordering)
Any numbered step in the agent body. Changes what the agent does when dispatched.
- Constraint: one step at a time, never reorder all steps at once

**Lever C — Examples** (dispatch clarity for ambiguous roles)
`<example>` blocks inside the `description:` field (multi-line YAML block scalar).
- Constraint: examples must reflect real dispatch scenarios, not idealized ones

**Lever D — What NOT to Do** (scope containment)
The `## What NOT to Do` section in the agent body.
- Constraint: don't move core workflow logic here; this section is for constraints, not steps

**Lever E — Frontmatter config** (cost and tool compliance)
The `model:` and `tools:` frontmatter fields.
- Constraint: never expand `tools:` beyond what the role requires; always re-run agent-audit after any Lever E mutation before scoring. A BLOCK verdict = score 0, revert immediately.
- `model:` haiku for lightweight tasks, sonnet for reasoning, opus for complex orchestration
- `tools:` trim to minimum; never add tools not in the source without explicit user approval

---

## Good vs Bad Mutations

**Good mutations:**
- Add a specific "Use when" condition addressing the most common dispatch failure
- Reword an ambiguous "Use when" clause to be more explicit
- Add a negative example ("not when X") for a recurring false dispatch
- Move a buried dispatch condition higher in the description (priority = position)
- Add or improve an `<example>` block showing the correct dispatch trigger
- Remove a workflow step that causes tool scope violations
- Trim `tools:` to remove a tool the agent never uses

**Bad mutations:**
- Rewriting the entire agent definition from scratch
- Adding multiple rules in one iteration
- Making the agent file longer without a specific reason
- Adding vague instructions like "be more careful" or "do better"
- Changing both description and a workflow step in the same iteration
- Expanding `tools:` without re-running agent-audit

## Hypothesis Generation Guide

| Failure mode | Lever | Example hypothesis |
|-------------|-------|--------------------|
| Agent doesn't dispatch | A | Add/clarify "Use when" trigger conditions |
| Agent over-dispatches (low dispatch accuracy) | A | Narrow description: add specific role qualifier |
| **Adversarial false dispatch** (resilience < 8) | **A** | Add "not when [wrong scope]" to description; add negative example |
| Step was skipped | B | Add explicit output requirement to step N |
| **Multi-turn re-asks established context** | **B** | Add continuation-awareness note: "If prior context established [X], skip asking for it" |
| Output wrong format | C | Add example showing correct output format |
| Tool scope violation (TOOL_VIOLATION flag) | D or E | Add "Never use [tool]" to What NOT to Do, or remove from tools: list |
| Agent costs too much for lightweight task | E | Downgrade model: sonnet → haiku |
| Agent uses undeclared tools | E | Add missing tool to tools: list; re-run agent-audit |

**Coverage tracking** — note which lever type was used each iteration. Vary lever types in iterations 1–4 (explore). Exploit the best-performing lever in iterations 5+.

## Convergence Criteria

Stop the loop when ANY of:

1. `eval_pass_rate ≥ 80%` AND `dispatch_accuracy ≥ 85%` AND `resilience_score ≥ 8` → **DONE**
2. All three ≥ 95% for 3 consecutive experiments → **DONE** (diminishing returns)
3. Budget exhausted with no improvement in last 2 iterations → **DONE**
4. All generated hypotheses have been tested → **DONE**
5. `eval_pass_rate < 40%` after 5 iterations → **REWRITE** — recommend writing a new agent definition
6. Project Fit Score < 7 AND (project-native or project-workflow failed) → **RE-ADAPT** — do not enter refinement loop
   Exception: if ONLY multi-turn failed, this is NOT an exit condition — continue with Lever B
