# Decision — Hermes local-first, deploy to Hostinger

> **Status: candidate** (awaiting `brain-promote --approve --to active`).

## Decision
Build the Hermes runtime **locally, containerized (Docker/compose) from day one**. Treat the Hostinger
VPS (Ubuntu/Docker) as a **deploy target, not the development workshop**. Provision and harden the VPS
**early, in parallel**, and run continuous **staging deploys with dummy credentials**. Introduce real,
money-spending / client-facing credentials on the VPS **only after** the credential vault and HITL loop
are hardened and security-reviewed.

## Why
- **Iteration speed:** a runtime (vault, HITL pause/resume, discovery loader, tool execution, staging
  enforcement) is heavy trial-and-error; the local loop is minutes vs. an SSH round-trip.
- **Dev/prod parity for free:** developing in Docker makes "deploy" = "run the same containers on the
  VPS," which neutralizes the main reason to start on the server (parity / "works on my machine").
- **Repo is the source of truth:** the project is filesystem-as-registry + git; `install.sh` already
  embodies the factory-here / deploy-there model. VPS = where Hermes runs deployments and spawned projects.
- **Security (weighted heavily):** Hermes holds live credentials for money-spending, client-facing
  systems (Google Ads, Meta, WordPress). A half-built, secret-holding runtime must not sit on an
  internet-exposed box. Harden locally with dummy creds; deploy a known-good artifact to a secured host.

## Consequences / path
1. Design Hermes (spec) — discovery loader, credential vault, HITL loop, staging enforcement, budget-cap
   checks, pack mounting.
2. Build locally in Docker against the proven declarative pack contract.
3. Provision + harden the VPS in parallel (non-root deploy user, firewall, SSH-keys-only, fail2ban);
   wire staging deploys with dummy credentials.
4. Harden vault/HITL, security-review, then introduce real credentials on the VPS.
5. Cut over; "spawn new project" = `install.sh` + Hermes registration on the box.

## Alternative rejected
**VPS-first (develop on Hostinger).** Rejected: trades the fast local feedback loop and a safe place to
get credential handling right for a parity benefit that containers already provide, while widening the
security exposure window.
